Description: Provides access to the 'Astronomy Engine' C library
    (<https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy>) by Don Cross. The library
    calculates positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, and predicts
    astronomical events such as rise/set times, lunar phases, equinoxes,
    solstices, eclipses, and transits. It is based on the 'VSOP87' planetary
    model and is accurate to within approximately one arcminute. This package
    bundles the single-file C source so that other R packages can link against
    it via 'LinkingTo' without shipping their own copy.
