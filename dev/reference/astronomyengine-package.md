# astronomyengine: R Bindings to the 'Astronomy Engine' C Library

Provides access to the 'Astronomy Engine' C library
(<https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy>) by Don Cross. The library
calculates positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets, and predicts
astronomical events such as rise/set times, lunar phases, equinoxes,
solstices, eclipses, and transits. It is based on the 'VSOP87' planetary
model and is accurate to within approximately one arcminute. This
package bundles the single-file C source so that other R packages can
link against it via 'LinkingTo' without shipping their own copy.
