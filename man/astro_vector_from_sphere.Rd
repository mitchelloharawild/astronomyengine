\title{Convert spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates}
\usage{
astro_vector_from_sphere(sphere, time)

astro_vector_from_sphere(sphere, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{sphere}{A list with named elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{lat}: Latitude in degrees (declination-like angle)
\item \code{lon}: Longitude in degrees (right ascension-like angle)
\item \code{dist}: Distance in astronomical units (AU)
}}

\item{time}{A POSIXct object representing the date and time.}
}
\value{
A list representing a vector with components:
\describe{
\item{x}{The Cartesian x-coordinate in AU}
\item{y}{The Cartesian y-coordinate in AU}
\item{z}{The Cartesian z-coordinate in AU}
\item{t}{The date and time (POSIXct) at which this vector is valid}
\item{status}{Status code (0 = success)}
}

A list representing a Cartesian vector with elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z}: Cartesian coordinates in AU
\item \code{t}: Time value
\item \code{status}: Status code (0 = success)
}
}
\description{
Given spherical coordinates and a time at which they are valid,
returns a vector of Cartesian coordinates. The returned value
includes the time, as required by the vector type.

Given spherical coordinates and a time at which they are valid,
returns a vector of Cartesian coordinates. The returned value
includes the time, as required by the vector structure.
